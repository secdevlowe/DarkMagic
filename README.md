# Darkʞᴉƃɐꟽ
An original custom Vivaldi web browser theme. 

This theme is designed to provide a rich, immersive user experience, leveraging a dark template with a vibrant, contrasting color palette primarily composed of a blend of bright purples and greens. The carefully curated selection of uniquely customized icons is centered around a medieval-fantasy-magic aesthetic, resulting in an unparalleled, cohesive, and definitive user interface that facilitates effortless navigation.

The theme's name, "Darkʞᴉƃɐꟽ," reflects its focus on evoking the mystical, dark magic-based abilities of an evil/necromancer-type spell caster class, as embodied by the icons and imagery used throughout the theme.
